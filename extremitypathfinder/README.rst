**Required data format:**
Ensure that all the following conditions on the polygons are fulfilled:

- numpy or python array of coordinate tuples: ``[(x1,y1), (x2,y2,)...]``
- the first point is NOT repeated at the end
- must at least contain 3 vertices
- no consequent vertices with identical coordinates in the polygons (same coordinates in general are allowed)
- a polygon must not have self intersections
- polygons must not intersect each other
- edge numbering has to follow this convention (for easier computations):
    - outer boundary polygon: counter clockwise
    - holes: clockwise


::

    # counter clockwise vertex numbering!
    boundary_coordinates = [(0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (9.0, 5.0), (10.0, 10.0), (0.0, 10.0)]

    # clockwise numbering!
    list_of_holes = [[(3.0, 7.0), (5.0, 9.0), (4.5, 7.0), (5.0, 4.0), ], ]
    environment.store(boundary_coordinates, list_of_holes, validate=False)

**BETA**: Pass ``validate=True`` in order to check the condition on the data.

**NOTE**: If two Polygons have vertices with identical coordinates (this is allowed), paths through these vertices are theoretically possible!
When the paths should be blocked, use a single polygon with multiple identical vertices instead (also allowed).

Basic Idea
==========


Well described in `[1, Ch. II 3.2] <http://www.cs.au.dk/~gerth/advising/thesis/anders-strand-holm-vinther_magnus-strand-holm-vinther.pdf>`__:

A map/environment/world of a given shortest path problem can be represented by one boundary polygon with holes (themselves polygons).

**IDEA**: Two categories of vertices/corners can be distinguished in these kind of environments:

* protruding corners (hereafter called **"Extremities"**, marked in red)
* all others

.. image:: ./img/map_plot.png


Extremities have an inner angle (facing towards the inside of the environment) of > 180 degree.
As long as there are no obstacles between two points present, it is obviously always best (=shortest) to move to the goal point directly.
When obstacles obstruct the direct path (goal is not directly 'visible' from the start) however, extremities (and only extremities!) have to be visited to reach the areas "behind" them until the goal is directly visible.


One can build a so called "**Visibility Graph**" with just extremities, start and goal and compute the shortest path on it. In a visibility graph two nodes are connected iff there is nothing obstructing the path between them. **The path obtained by this algorithm is guaranteed to be optimal**, meaning that there exists no shorter path between start and goal.


**Improvement:** As described in `[1, Ch. II 4.4.2 "Property One"] <http://www.cs.au.dk/~gerth/advising/thesis/anders-strand-holm-vinther_magnus-strand-holm-vinther.pdf>`__ the visibility graph can be reduced even further without the loss of guaranteed optimality:
Starting from any point lying "in front of" an extremity ``e`` (both adjacent edges are at least partly visible) one will never visit ``e``, because everything is reachable on a shorter path without ``e`` (except ``e`` itself). An extremity ``e1`` lying in the area "in front of"
extremity ``e`` hence is never the next vertex in a shortest path coming from ``e``. And also in reverse: when coming from ``e1`` everything else than ``e`` itself can be reached more directly without visiting ``e1`. As a consequence ``e`` and ``e1`` do not have to be connected in the graph. After deleting these kind of edges the visibility graph is minimal for the purpose of shortest path computation, i.e. no edge can be deleted without loosing guaranteed optimality `[1, Ch. II 4.4.2 "VGO" p.35] <http://www.cs.au.dk/~gerth/advising/thesis/anders-strand-holm-vinther_magnus-strand-holm-vinther.pdf>`__.



Algorithm
=========

This package pretty much implements the Visibility Graph Optimized (VGO) Algorithm described in `[1, Ch. II 4.4.2 "VGO" p.34] <http://www.cs.au.dk/~gerth/advising/thesis/anders-strand-holm-vinther_magnus-strand-holm-vinther.pdf>`__, just with a few computational tweaks:


Rough Procedure:
________________

- **1. Preprocessing the map:** Independently of any query start and goal points the optimized visibility graph is being computed for the static environment once with ``map.prepare()``. Later versions might include a faster approach to compute visibility on the fly, for use cases where the map is changing dynamically (after every query). The edges of the precomputed graph between the extremities are shown in red in the following plots. Notice that the extremity on the right is not connected to any other extremity due to the above mentioned optimisation:


.. image:: ./img/prepared_map_plot.png


- **2. Including start and goal:** For each shortest path query the start and goal points are being connected to the internal graph depending on their visibility. Notice that the added edges are directed and also here the optimisation is being used to reduce the amount of edges in the graph, in order to reduce the time needed for the next step:

.. image:: ./img/graph_plot.png

- **3. A-star shortest path computation :** Finding the shortest path on graphs is a standard computer science problem. This package uses a modified version of the popular ``A*-Algorithm`` optimized for this special use case.

Tweaks (my contribution):
_________________________

**Visibility detection:** my **"Angle Range Elimination Algorithm"** (AREA)

To my knowledge there was no previous algorithm for computing the visibility of points (<-> visibility graph) that is visiting edges at most once without any trigonometric computations, without sorting and with that few distance/intersection checks.

Simple fundamental idea: points (extremities) are visible when there is no edge running in front "blocking the view".

Rough procedure: For all edges delete the points lying behind them. Points that remain at the end are visible.

In this use case we are not interested in the full visibility graph, but the visibility of just some points (extremities, start and goal). Additionally deciding if a point lies behind an edge can often be done without computing intersections by just comparing distances. This can be used to reduce the needed computations.

Further speed up can be accomplished by trying to prioritize closer edges, because they have a bigger chance to eliminate candidates, which then in the future do need to be checked any more.

The worst case time complexity of this algorithm is :math:`O(m^2 n)`, where m is the amount of extremities (candidates) and n is the amount of edges (= #vertices). This is fast, because of the above mentioned tweaks and usually :math:`m << n`.

Implemented in ``PolygonEnvironment.find_visible()`` in ``extremitypathfinder.py``

**Comparison:**

Lee's visibility graph algorithm (complexity :math:`O(n^2 log_2 n)`): cf. http://cs.smith.edu/~streinu/Teaching/Courses/274/Spring98/Projects/Philip/fp/algVisibility.htm

- Initially all edges are being checked for intersection
- Necessarily checking the visibility of all points
- Always checking all points in every run
- One intersection computation for most points (always when T is not empty)
- Sorting: all points according to degree on startup, edges in binary tree T
- Can work with just lines (not restricted to polygons)



My Algorithm:

- Checking all edges
- Not considering all points (just a few candidates)
- Decreasing number of candidates with every run (visibility is a symmetric relation -> only need to check once for every point pair!)
- Intersection computation only for a fraction of candidates
- No sorting needed
- Could theoretically also work with just lines (this package however currently just allows polygons)
- More simple and clear approach



**Angle representation**: Instead of computing directly with angles in degree or radians, it is much more efficient and still sufficient to use a representation that is mapping an angle to a range :math:`a \in [0.0 ; 4.0[` (:math:`[0.0 ; 1.0[` in all 4 quadrants). This can be done without computationally expensive trigonometric functions!
Check the implementation in class ``AngleRepresentation`` in ``helper_classes.py``.


**Modifications to A-star:** The basic algorithm has been modified to exploit the following geometrical property of 2D euclidean environments (and hence also their extracted visibility graph):

    It is always shortest to directly reach a node instead of visiting other nodes first
    (there is never an advantage through reduced edge weight).

In A* the neighbour with the lowest total cost estimate is always being visited next. So the above mentioned property can be exploited in a lot of cases to make A* run faster and terminate earlier than for general graphs:

- no need to revisit nodes (path only gets longer)

- not all neighbours of the current node have to be checked like in vanilla A* before continuing to the next node.

- when the goal is directly reachable, there can be no other shorter path to it -> terminate.


Implemented in ``graph_search.py``


**Laziness:** I will write this later...


Comparison to pyvisgraph
========================

This package is similar to `pyvisgraph <https://github.com/TaipanRex/pyvisgraph>`__ which uses Lee's algorithm.


**Pros:**

- very reduced visibility graph (time and memory!)
- algorithms optimized for path finding
- possibility to convert and use grid worlds


**Cons:**

- parallel computing not supported so far
- no existing speed comparison
